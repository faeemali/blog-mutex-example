        Notice how the data change code has been moved to a different function. What we're going to
        do here is perform a mutable borrow and change the data, then perform an immutable borrow
        and view the changed data (in a different function just to illustrate we don't deadlock),
        and finally perform a mutable borrow again to change the data one last time.

        We cannot do all those things at once without violating Rust's borrow checking rules. The solution
        is to perform the first borrow, change the data, then drop the borrow, After that, we perform
        the second borrow, view the data, and drop the borrow. And finally, we perform a borrow, change the data,
        and drop the borrow. The drop happens at the end of the function eg. it happens when we return
        from reentrant_mut_change_data(). So, by moving some the logic to different functions, we do
        not violate Rust's borrow rules!

        To get a runtime error, copy the contents of reentrant_mut_change_data() here instead of
        calling a different function. The code will compile, but it will panic at runtime, as per
        the RefCell documentation.
